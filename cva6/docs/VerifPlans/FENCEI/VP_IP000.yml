        description: The instruction immediately before FENCE.I, the FENCE.I instruction
          and the instruction immediately following FENCE.I are fetched into the CVA6.
          Instruction data for the next PC must be fetched after the FENCE.I instruction
          has executed (because only then can data-side stores have completed and
          caches have been updated).

        verif_goals: Check that after a FENCE.I instruction retires then instr-side
          AXI fetches the next instruction to be executed. (in both cases; with and
          without a FENCE.I instruction inserted)
