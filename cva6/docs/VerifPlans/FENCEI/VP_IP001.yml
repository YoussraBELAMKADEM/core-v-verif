        description: The FENCE.I instruction is used to synchronize the instruction
          and data streams. RISC-V does not guarantee that stores to instruction memory
          will be made visible to instruction fetches on a RISC-V hart until that
          hart executes a FENCE.I instruction. To make a store to instruction memory
          visible to all RISC-V harts, the writing hart has to execute a data FENCE
          before requesting that all remote RISC-V harts execute a FENCE.I.

          \ store instructions shall have their effects visible to the Instruction\
          \ Fetch of the instructions that are to be executed after the FENCE.I instruction.\n\
          Do a FENCE.I, but right before the fencei do a store to the instruction\
          \ following the FENCE.I, then see that the newly stored value is executed\
          \ instead of the old instruction (e.g. change addi to use a different immediate)."
