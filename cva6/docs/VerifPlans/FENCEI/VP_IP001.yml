        verif_goals: Do a FENCE.I, but right before the fencei do a store to the instruction
          following the FENCE.I, then see that the newly stored value is executed
          instead of the old instruction (e.g. change addi to use a different immediate).

        verif_goals: Check that after having read one value from an address, then
          after storing a value to that same address, if executing that address then
          the value shall always be that which was written (should work well in both
          sim/formal).
